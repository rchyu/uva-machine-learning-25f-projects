# Data Usage

## Our Custom Dataset
Our custom dataset consists of labeled images of common refrigerator items captured under various conditions:
- Different lighting scenarios
- Various angles and positions
- Different levels of occlusion (hands)
- Multiple instances of the same item type

Dataset Format: YOLOv5 PyTorch format via Roboflow
- Images with bounding box annotations
- Train/validation/test splits managed through Roboflow

The dataset is managed through Roboflow and accessed via API during model training.

## Data Access
Since we access the data directly through Roboflow via API, please contact us if you would like the key to replicate the model training.

The data is also located in a zip file under the `data/` directory. However, it is not integrated into the actual model training code.
